# ChatGPT Usage

This project visualizes ChatGPT and Claude usage patterns by analyzing conversation data and generating heatmaps for daily activity. The analysis is based on scripts inspired by [Chip Huyen](https://lnkd.in/eexMWvt8)'s work, and aims to uncover trends in AI conversation frequencies over time.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to:
- **Visualize daily ChatGPT and Claude conversation counts** in 2024 and 2025.
- **Generate heatmaps** to identify peak activity times and trends in AI usage.
- **Compare usage patterns** between two AI systems: ChatGPT and Claude.

The data is analyzed and transformed into daily activity counts, then visualized using heatmaps for easy interpretation.

## Requirements

To run the project and reproduce the analysis, you need the following Python libraries:
- `json`
- `pytz`
- `datetime`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `collections`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pytz matplotlib numpy
```
